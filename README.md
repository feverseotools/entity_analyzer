Semantic SEO Analyzer

An advanced application to analyze the semantic content of web pages and optimize them for modern search engine algorithms, with an emphasis on semantic understanding and E-E-A-T.

Main Features

URL Semantic Analysis: Extraction of named entities, identification of topics, and evaluation of content structure.
Semantic Relevance Scoring: Calculation of the semantic similarity between the content and target keywords.
Improvement Recommendations: Prioritized, actionable suggestions to enhance semantic relevance.
Algorithm Interpretation: Simulation of how a modern search engine might interpret the content.
Technologies Used

Frontend: Streamlit for an intuitive interface and interactive visualizations
Backend: Python with libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and trafilatura for web processing
NLP Engine: Integration with the OpenAI API for advanced semantic analysis
Visualization: Plotly for interactive charts
Installation

Clone this repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/semantic-seo-analyzer.git
Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd semantic-seo-analyzer
Install the dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
Bash

streamlit run app.py
Usage

Obtain an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI Platform.
Enter it in the corresponding field in the application's sidebar.
Enter the URL you wish to analyze.
Optionally, add keywords for relevance scoring and recommendations.
Click "Analyze URL" and explore the results in the different tabs.

Limitations

The analysis is based on the OpenAI API, so a valid API key is required.
The analysis is limited by the maximum context length of OpenAI's models.
The interpretation of how Google evaluates content is an educated simulation, not an exact representation of proprietary algorithms.
